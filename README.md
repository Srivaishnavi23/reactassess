# My Best Friend

Using Dog API, My Best Friend is an app where users can browse and select a dog breed and sub-breed to view a collection of images.

## Motivation

This app was built as a code challenge to showcase my skills in front-end engineering and design across layout presentation, user interface, and user experience.

## Tech/framework used
Built with
* React
* Redux
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Proprietary Design System

## Installation
* fork this repo & clone locally
* cd client from your local directory
* run npm install

npm install should automatically open a new tab in your browser to http://localhost:3000 for you to view the app.
